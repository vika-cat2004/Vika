loped for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, b
ut has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.[22] Because of
 the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux, including Android, has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems, as of May 2022.[23][24][25] Although Linux is, as of November 2022, used by only around 2.6 percent of desktop computers,[26] the Chromebook, which runs the Linux kernel-based ChromeOS, dominates the US Kâ€“12 education market and represents nearly 20 percent of sub-$300 notebook sales in the US.[27] Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[28] leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers[d] (as of November 2017, having gradually displaced all competitors).[29][30][31]

Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose op
erating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored t
o the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home devices, vi
deo game consoles,[32] televisions (Samsung and LG Smart TVs),[33][34][35] automobiles
 (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Toyota),[36] and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon c
 rew capsule and the Perseverance rover).[37][38]
